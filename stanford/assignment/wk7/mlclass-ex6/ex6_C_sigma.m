%  This file contains code that helps you get started on the
%  exercise. You will need to complete the following functions:
%
%     gaussianKernel.m
%     dataset3Params.m
%     processEmail.m
%     emailFeatures.m

%% ========== Part 7: Training SVM with RBF Kernel (Dataset 3) ==========

%  This is a different dataset that you can use to experiment with. Try
%  different values of C and sigma here.
% 

% Load from ex6data3: 
% You will have X, y in your environment
load('ex6data3.mat');

fprintf('Loading and Visualizing Data ...\n')
% Plot training data
plotData(X, y);

% Try different SVM Parameters here
[C, sigma] = dataset3Params(X, y, Xval, yval);

% Train the SVM
model= svmTrain(X, y, C, @(x1, x2) gaussianKernel(x1, x2, sigma));
visualizeBoundary(X, y, model);

% save data as MATlab-v6 binary format, otherwise it is as text format.
%save('-6','ex6_results.mat', ')
save -6 ex6_results.mat C sigma

fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
